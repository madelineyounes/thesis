/home/z5208494/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/transformers/configuration_utils.py:363: UserWarning: Passing `gradient_checkpointing` to a config initialization is deprecated and will be removed in v5 Transformers. Using `model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()` instead, or if you are using the `Trainer` API, pass `gradient_checkpointing=True` in your `TrainingArguments`.
  warnings.warn(
Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-base were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification: ['project_hid.weight', 'project_q.weight', 'project_q.bias', 'quantizer.weight_proj.weight', 'quantizer.codevectors', 'project_hid.bias', 'quantizer.weight_proj.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight', 'classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
max_steps is given, it will override any value given in num_train_epochs
