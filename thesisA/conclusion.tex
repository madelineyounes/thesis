\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

This report has explored the challenges in designing a reliable Arabic DID and the need for 
more accurate systems. It proposes using semi-self supervised transfer learning as an approach 
to improve Arabic DIDs. It then has provided a literature review of current methodologies for LID and DID
systems. As well as the justification behind the pretrained models and downstream models which will be 
researched during this thesis. It has outlined the proposed method and then went into some preliminary work performed, particularly some 
data analysis on the ADI17 dataset. Finally, this report has provided a timeline, task break down and the challenges that may be encountered
during this thesis were examined.
