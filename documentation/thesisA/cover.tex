\begin{abstract}
    This report preposes a thesis to develop a novel approach to Dialectal Identification 
    (DID) through utilising  pre-trained end-to-end speech recognition model for low 
    resource dialects, particularly Arabic. It explores the motivation for a thesis 
    that explores the use of using transfer learning and semi-self supervised machine 
    learning methods in improving Dialectal Identification systems particularly for Arabic 
    dialects. This report also, examines current literature on methods used in 
    Language Identification (LID) and Dialect Identification (DID), as well as 
    their shortcomings. There has been a significant amount of research into transfer 
    learning for English based downstream tasks while the technology has not progressed 
    to the same extent for low resource languages. In addition to this there has been 
    limited research into using transfer based learning for LID and DID tasks. 
    In the later half of this paper will present planning for the remainder 
    of the thesis, as well as the preliminary work which has been conducted.
